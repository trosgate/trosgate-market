16. ** Supported Countries:** More often than not, it does not make sense for a startup company to
accept every user in every country (even when they have little resource to start with). This is why
Trosgate changes the game of Freelance and employment webmasters
Have a look at the screenshot below. In Admin View:

a) **Activate countries:** The dropdown button that lets you select multiple buttons and
activate with a single click

b) **Deactivate countries:** The dropdown button that lets you select multiple buttons and
deactivate with a single click

c) **Supported button:** Manually selects each country to activate or deactivate

d) **Ordering Priority:** Set the country you want to appear to customer first followed by
others in ascending order. It is that simple

17. **Custom Two Factor Authenticator (2FA):** When 2FA SMS Auth is launched by Admin:

a) A merchant with all its users who logged-in will have an extra layer to enter dynamically generated token

b) This token is system generated and will be sent to logged-in user email eg, gmail , over
SMTP server and TLS layer

c) Customer gets token from email to authenticate

18. **Team and the Packages**

Various merchant sites come as a package defaulting to free tier.

Under each merchant site, they can also upsell packages to their freelancers who are always created with a team. 

Almost nothing can be achieved by the freelancer on Trosgate Software without a team
