NEW USER CREATION FROM DIGITALOCEAN DASHBOARD
Just incase we want to use that to authenticate with github workflow
..........................................

Here are the steps to create a new user account on DigitalOcean 
and set up password authentication:

Log in to your DigitalOcean account and navigate to the "Droplets" section of the dashboard.
Click on the name of the droplet that you want to deploy your Django project to.
In the "Access" tab, click on the "Launch Console" button to open a web-based terminal window.
Once the terminal window opens, log in as the root user using your root password.
Once logged in, create a new user account by running the following command:

..........................................
adduser <username>
..........................................

Replace <username> with the name you want to give the new user account. 
You will be prompted to set a password and enter additional information 
like full name and phone number, but these are optional.

Add the new user account to the sudo group so that it has permission to run commands as root:

..........................................
usermod -aG sudo <username>
..........................................

Exit the terminal window by typing exit or closing the browser tab.
Now that you have created a new user account, 
you can use it to authenticate with your DigitalOcean server during the deployment process.

To use this new user account with GitHub workflows, you will need 
to create a new set of credentials (i.e. username and password) that can 
be used to authenticate with the server. You can store the username and password 
as secrets in your GitHub repository settings, which will allow the workflow to 
access them during deployment without revealing them to the public.
